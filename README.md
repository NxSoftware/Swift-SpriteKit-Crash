This is a small sample project that demonstrates several crashes in SpriteKit when using Swift with Fast (-O) optimisation.

It is a companion to a [blog post](http://stevewilford.co.uk/2015/05/swift-optimiser-causing-a-crash-in-spritekit-app/) where I document my encounter and subsequent investigation into these crashes.
